				The ability to make the world a better place with a mix of technical excellence and creativity is what makes engineering 
				one of the most rewarding disciplines.<br/><br/>I've worked on science and engineering projects for most of my life, from 
				elementary school with my dad's help, through my years at UC Berkeley studying mechanical engineering. I've worked on a wide 
				variety of projects, some of which are included on the projects page of this site. Going forward, I hope to work professionally 
				on full stack software engineering, machine learning, and even robotics/controls, improving lives one line of code 
				at a time. In my free time, I love playing basketball, although I practiced and taught martial arts growing up, eventually
				reaching 4th degree black belt. I also love playing the guitar (though I have a lot of room to improve), and spending
				time with my two dogs.
