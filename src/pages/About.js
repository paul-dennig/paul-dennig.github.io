		About
	</h1>
	<p>
		I've worked on science and engineering projects for most of my life, from elementary school with my dad's help, through my years at UC Berkeley studying mechanical engineering. The ability to make the world a better place with a mix of technical excellence and creativity is what makes engineering one of the most rewarding disciplines. I've worked on a wide variety of projects, some of which are included below. Going forward, I hope to work professionally on general software engineering, robotics/controls, and machine learning projects, improving lives one line of code at a time. In my free time, I love playing basketball, playing the guitar (though I have a lot of room to improve), and spending time with my two dogs. After a long day of work, tail wags are one of the best ways to unwind.
